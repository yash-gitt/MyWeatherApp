In this project I create a Weather Application in which we can see the weather detail of any city in the world.

Technoloy i used in this project is HTML5,CSS3,JAVASCRIPT,APIs.

In this Application first i create three dropdown Country, State and City for ex. if we select any specific country then all states of that country will populated in state dropdown then we have to select specific state like that we have to select city also. Once we select city then the weather detail of that city will display automatically. To get all the weather details i used two APIs in this project .

Country State City API is use to get all the name of all the countries states and cities in the world.

Openweathermap API is use to get all the details of weather.
